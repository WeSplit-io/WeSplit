## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Firebase Collections Structure
```
users/
  - userId: { name, email, wallet_address, wallet_public_key, created_at, avatar }

groups/
  - groupId: { name, description, category, currency, icon, color, created_by, created_at, updated_at, member_count, expense_count }

groupMembers/
  - memberId: { group_id, user_id, name, email, wallet_address, wallet_public_key, joined_at }

expenses/
  - expenseId: { description, amount, currency, paid_by, group_id, category, split_type, split_data, created_at, updated_at }

transactions/
  - transactionId: { type, amount, currency, from_user, to_user, from_wallet, to_wallet, tx_hash, note, status, created_at, updated_at }

notifications/
  - notificationId: { userId, type, title, message, data, is_read, created_at }

contacts/
  - contactId: { user_id, contact_id, name, email, wallet_address, wallet_public_key, first_met_at, mutual_groups_count, isFavorite }
```
