# Runtime Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The app was experiencing a "property is not configurable" runtime error that was preventing proper initialization. This error typically occurs when multiple polyfill systems try to define the same global properties, or when properties are already defined as non-configurable.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:

1. **Conflicting Global Property Definitions**: Multiple polyfill systems were trying to define the same global properties (like `Buffer`, `crypto`, etc.)
2. **Unsafe Property Assignment**: Direct assignment to global properties without checking if they were already defined or configurable
3. **Duplicate Polyfill Imports**: The same polyfills were being imported in multiple places
4. **New Architecture Mismatch**: The app was configured with `newArchEnabled: false` while Expo Go was using the new architecture

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Safe Polyfill System (`src/config/safePolyfills.ts`)
- Created a comprehensive safe polyfill initialization system
- Added `defineGlobalProperty()` function that checks if properties are configurable before defining them
- Added `assignGlobalProperty()` function for safe property assignment
- Implemented proper error handling and logging for all polyfill operations

### 2. Runtime Error Handler (`src/config/runtimeErrorHandler.ts`)
- Created a global error handler system to catch and log runtime errors
- Added handlers for unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions
- Implemented React Native specific error handling
- Added safe property access and definition helpers

### 3. Updated Main Polyfills (`polyfills.ts`)
- Simplified the main polyfills file to use the new safe polyfill system
- Removed direct global property assignments
- Added proper error handling initialization

### 4. Fixed App Configuration (`app.config.js`)
- Changed `newArchEnabled` from `false` to `true` to match Expo Go's architecture
- This resolves the New Architecture warning

### 5. Enhanced Crypto Stub (`src/config/crypto-stub.js`)
- Added try-catch blocks around global property access
- Made the crypto stub more defensive against property access errors

### 6. Removed Duplicate Imports (`App.tsx`)
- Removed duplicate `react-native-get-random-values` import from App.tsx
- This prevents conflicts with the centralized polyfill system

## Key Features of the Fix

### Safe Property Definition
```typescript
const defineGlobalProperty = (name: string, value: any, options: {
  writable?: boolean;
  enumerable?: boolean;
  configurable?: boolean;
} = {}): boolean => {
  try {
    if (typeof (global as any)[name] !== 'undefined') {
      return true; // Already defined
    }

    const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(global, name);
    if (descriptor && descriptor.configurable === false) {
      logger.warn(`Global property ${name} is not configurable, skipping definition`);
      return false;
    }

    Object.defineProperty(global, name, {
      value,
      writable: options.writable !== false,
      enumerable: options.enumerable !== false,
      configurable: options.configurable !== false,
    });

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.warn(`Failed to define global property ${name}`, { error });
    return false;
  }
};
```

### Global Error Handling
```typescript
export const setupGlobalErrorHandlers = () => {
  // Handle unhandled promise rejections
  global.onunhandledrejection = (event: any) => {
    logger.error('Unhandled promise rejection', { 
      reason: event.reason,
      promise: event.promise 
    }, 'RuntimeErrorHandler');
  };

  // Handle uncaught exceptions
  global.onerror = (message: string, source?: string, lineno?: number, colno?: number, error?: Error) => {
    logger.error('Uncaught exception', { 
      message, source, lineno, colno, error 
    }, 'RuntimeErrorHandler');
    return false;
  };
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Runtime Crashes**: The safe property definition system prevents "property is not configurable" errors
2. **Better Error Logging**: All errors are now properly logged with context
3. **Defensive Programming**: The system gracefully handles conflicts and errors
4. **Architecture Consistency**: Fixed the New Architecture mismatch warning
5. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized polyfill management makes the codebase easier to maintain

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test App Initialization**: Verify that the app starts without runtime errors
2. **Test Polyfill Functionality**: Ensure that Buffer, crypto, and other polyfills work correctly
3. **Test Error Handling**: Verify that errors are properly logged and don't crash the app
4. **Test on Different Platforms**: Test on both iOS and Android to ensure compatibility

## Files Modified

- `polyfills.ts` - Simplified to use safe polyfill system
- `src/config/safePolyfills.ts` - New safe polyfill initialization system
- `src/config/runtimeErrorHandler.ts` - New runtime error handling system
- `app.config.js` - Fixed New Architecture setting
- `src/config/crypto-stub.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `App.tsx` - Removed duplicate polyfill import

## Next Steps

1. Test the app bundle to ensure the runtime error is resolved
2. Monitor logs for any remaining polyfill-related warnings
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms if needed
4. Update documentation to reflect the new polyfill system

The fixes should resolve the "property is not configurable" error and provide a more robust foundation for the app's polyfill system.
