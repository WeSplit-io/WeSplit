# Wallet Recovery Security Fixes

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. User-Wallet Mapping Vulnerability
**Problem**: Legacy wallet recovery assigns current userId to ALL found wallets without verification.

**Fix**: Implement proper user-wallet validation before assignment.

### 2. Cross-User Wallet Contamination
**Problem**: AsyncStorage and SecureStore searches return wallets from all users.

**Fix**: Add user-specific validation and filtering.

### 3. Insecure Legacy Recovery
**Problem**: No verification that recovered wallets actually belong to the current user.

**Fix**: Implement cryptographic proof of ownership.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix walletRecoveryService.ts** - Add user validation
2. **Implement wallet ownership verification**
3. **Add user-specific storage keys**
4. **Create wallet migration strategy**

## Security Impact
- **HIGH**: Users could access other users' wallets
- **HIGH**: Wallet funds could be stolen
- **CRITICAL**: Complete wallet system compromise

## Recommended Implementation
