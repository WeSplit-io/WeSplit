## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Missing AppContext Group Operations**
**Impact:** High - Core group functionality broken  
**Location:** `src/context/AppContext.tsx`  
**Issue:** The AppContext is missing essential group operation functions that are referenced in the UI but not implemented.

**Required Functions:**
```typescript
createGroup: (groupData: any) => Promise<GroupWithDetails>
updateGroup: (groupId: number, updates: any) => Promise<void>
deleteGroup: (groupId: number) => Promise<void>
leaveGroup: (groupId: number) => Promise<void>
selectGroup: (group: GroupWithDetails | null) => void
```

### 2. **Incomplete Add Expense Screen**
**Impact:** High - Expense creation functionality broken  
**Location:** `src/screens/AddExpense/AddExpenseScreen.tsx`  
**Issue:** Missing core expense creation logic and form validation.

**Missing Components:**
- Form validation for description and amount
- Participant selection and toggle logic
- Split mode handling (equal vs manual)
- Expense creation integration with AppContext

### 3. **Navigation Flow Issues**
**Impact:** Medium - User experience degraded  
**Location:** Multiple screens  
**Issue:** Incomplete navigation flows between group creation and success screens.

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (Critical - Fix Immediately)
1. **Implement missing AppContext group operations**
2. **Complete AddExpenseScreen form validation and logic**
3. **Fix navigation flows in group creation process**

### Priority 2 (High - Fix Soon)
1. **Add refresh functionality to GroupDetailsScreen**
2. **Implement balance display logic in SettleUpModal**

---

## üß™ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Required Tests:
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Group creation and management functions
   - Expense creation and calculation logic
   - Balance calculation algorithms
   - Data validation functions

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - End-to-end group creation flow
   - Expense addition and splitting
   - Balance calculation and display
   - Settlement process

3. **Error Scenario Tests:**
   - Network failures
   - Invalid data inputs
   - Permission denied scenarios
   - Concurrent operations

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### Key Performance Indicators:
- Group creation success rate: Target > 95%
- Expense addition success rate: Target > 98%
- Balance calculation accuracy: Target 100%
- User satisfaction score: Target > 4.5/5

### Monitoring Points:
- API response times
- Error rates by operation type
- User engagement metrics
- Data consistency checks

---

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 24-48 hours):
1. Fix critical AppContext missing functions
2. Complete AddExpenseScreen implementation
3. Test group creation flow end-to-end

### Short Term (Next week):
1. Implement all missing UI functionality
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Perform thorough testing

### Medium Term (Next month):
1. Add performance optimizations
2. Implement advanced features
3. Add comprehensive test coverage

---

## üìù CONCLUSION

The deep check revealed that while the core architecture is solid and mock data has been successfully removed, there are critical gaps in the AppContext implementation that prevent the group process from functioning properly. The immediate focus should be on implementing the missing group operations and completing the AddExpenseScreen functionality.

**Overall Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION** - Core functionality broken but fixable with focused effort.

**Confidence Level:** High - All issues identified are straightforward to fix with clear implementation paths.
