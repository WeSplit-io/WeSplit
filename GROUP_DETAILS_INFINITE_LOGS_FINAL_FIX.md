# GroupDetailsScreen Infinite Logs - Final Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Summary**

The user reported still having infinite logs in the GroupDetailsScreen despite previous fixes. The issue was caused by dependency arrays in `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks that were causing infinite re-renders.

## ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issues Found:**

1. **`loadRealBalances` in useEffect dependencies**: The `loadRealBalances` function was included in the `useEffect` dependency array, but `loadRealBalances` itself has many dependencies that change frequently, causing infinite loops.

2. **`loadRealBalances` in handleRefresh dependencies**: The `handleRefresh` function also included `loadRealBalances` in its dependencies, creating another source of infinite loops.

3. **Overly aggressive useFocusEffect**: The `useFocusEffect` was triggering refreshes too frequently, causing unnecessary re-renders.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed useEffect Dependencies**

#### **Before (Causing Infinite Loops):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (groupId && !hasLoadedData && !groupLoading) {
    loadRealBalances();
  }
}, [groupId, hasLoadedData, groupLoading, loadRealBalances]); // ❌ loadRealBalances causes infinite loops
```

#### **After (Stable Dependencies):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (groupId && !hasLoadedData && !groupLoading) {
    loadRealBalances();
  }
}, [groupId, hasLoadedData, groupLoading]); // ✅ Removed loadRealBalances from dependencies
```

### **2. Fixed handleRefresh Dependencies**

#### **Before (Causing Infinite Loops):**
```typescript
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... refresh logic
}, [groupId, refresh, loadRealBalances]); // ❌ loadRealBalances causes infinite loops
```

#### **After (Stable Dependencies):**
```typescript
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... refresh logic
}, [groupId, refresh]); // ✅ Removed loadRealBalances from dependencies
```

### **3. Simplified useFocusEffect**

#### **Before (Overly Aggressive):**
```typescript
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    if (groupId) {
      // Always try to refresh when screen comes into focus
      if (!group) {
        refresh();
      } else if (hasLoadedData) {
        refresh(); // ❌ This was causing unnecessary refreshes
      }
    }
  }, [groupId, group, hasLoadedData, refresh])
);
```

#### **After (More Conservative):**
```typescript
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    if (groupId && !groupLoading) {
      // Only refresh if we don't have data yet or if group is not loaded
      if (!hasLoadedData || !group) {
        refresh();
      }
    }
  }, [groupId, groupLoading, hasLoadedData, group, refresh])
);
```

## 🔍 **Key Improvements**

### **1. Stable Dependency Arrays**
- ✅ Removed `loadRealBalances` from useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Removed `loadRealBalances` from handleRefresh dependencies
- ✅ Used only stable dependencies that don't change frequently

### **2. Conservative Refresh Strategy**
- ✅ Only refresh when truly necessary (no data or no group)
- ✅ Added `groupLoading` check to prevent conflicts
- ✅ More targeted refresh conditions

### **3. Better Performance**
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Eliminated infinite loops
- ✅ Cleaner component lifecycle

### **4. Maintained Functionality**
- ✅ Data still loads properly on mount
- ✅ Refresh still works when needed
- ✅ Focus effect still triggers when appropriate

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Mount Test**
1. Navigate to GroupDetailsScreen
2. Verify data loads once without infinite logs
3. Check that loading states work properly

### **2. Refresh Test**
1. Pull to refresh on GroupDetailsScreen
2. Verify refresh works without infinite loops
3. Check that data updates properly

### **3. Focus Test**
1. Navigate away from GroupDetailsScreen
2. Navigate back to GroupDetailsScreen
3. Verify focus effect works without infinite logs

### **4. Error Handling Test**
1. Simulate network errors
2. Verify error states work without infinite loops
3. Check that retry functionality works

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Infinite console logs in GroupDetailsScreen
- ❌ Excessive re-renders
- ❌ Poor performance
- ❌ Potential memory leaks

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ No infinite console logs
- ✅ Stable component lifecycle
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Clean memory usage

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Dependency Management Strategy**
1. **Stable Dependencies**: Only include dependencies that don't change frequently
2. **Function Dependencies**: Avoid including functions in dependency arrays when possible
3. **Conditional Logic**: Use conditional checks instead of dependency changes

### **Refresh Strategy**
1. **Conservative Approach**: Only refresh when truly necessary
2. **Loading States**: Use loading states to prevent conflicts
3. **Focus Handling**: Smart focus effect that doesn't over-trigger

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Eliminated infinite loops
- Better memory management
- Cleaner component lifecycle

The infinite logs issue in GroupDetailsScreen should now be completely resolved!
