## 🧪 Test Steps Covered

### ✅ **Step 1: Create Group**
- Group document created in Firestore
- Creator added as initial member with admin role
- Group member count set to 1
- Context `userGroups` updated
- UI shows group in groups list

### ✅ **Step 2: Invite User**

- Invitation status set to 'pending'
- Invite link generated successfully

### ✅ **Step 3: User Joins via Notification**
- Invitation status updated to 'accepted'
- New member added to group members
- Group member count updated to 2
- Notification marked as read
- Context updated with new member

### ✅ **Step 4: Add Expense with Split Logic**
- Expense document created with all required fields
- Group expense count updated
- Group expenses_by_currency updated
- Split data calculated correctly
- Notifications sent to other members
- Context updated with new expense

### ✅ **Step 5: Leave Group**
- Group member removed from group members
- Group member count updated to 1
- Group still exists (not deleted)
- Context updated (group removed from user's groups)

### ✅ **Step 6: Delete Group**
- Group document deleted
- All group members deleted
- All group expenses deleted
- All group invitations deleted
- All group notifications deleted
- Context updated (group removed from all users)

## 🔍 Verification Points

### **Firestore Consistency**
- ✅ Group documents with proper structure
- ✅ Member documents with correct roles and status
- ✅ Expense documents with split calculations
- ✅ Notification documents for all events
- ✅ Atomic operations using transactions

### **Context Updates**
- ✅ `state.userGroups` updates after each operation
- ✅ `state.groupExpenses` updates with new expenses
- ✅ `state.notifications` updates with new notifications
- ✅ Real-time listener verification

### **UI Refresh**
- ✅ Navigation to appropriate screens
- ✅ Component re-rendering with new data
- ✅ Progress indicators and status updates
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Option 1: Run Simplified Test (No Setup Required)**
```bash
node test-group-lifecycle-simple.js
```

### **Option 2: Run Full Test (Requires Firebase Config)**
1. Add Firebase configuration to `test-group-lifecycle.js`
2. Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3. Run: `node test-group-lifecycle.js`

### **Option 3: Integrate into React Native App**
1. Add `GroupLifecycleTest` component to navigation
2. Add test button to settings or debug menu
3. Navigate to test screen and run tests

## 📊 Expected Results

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! Group lifecycle test completed successfully.
```
