# Dashboard Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Notification Service Errors**: `notificationService.initializePushNotifications` and `notificationService.getUserNotifications` were undefined
2. **UserAvatar Component Error**: `generateInitials` method was undefined, causing "Cannot read property 'generateInitials' of undefined" error
3. **Wallet Service Still Undefined**: The wallet service `createWalletFromMnemonic` method is still showing as undefined

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Notification Service Instance Access

**Problem**: The notification service was exported as an object with an `instance` getter, but the code was calling methods directly on the service object.

**Solution**: Updated all notification service calls to use `.instance`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
notificationService.initializePushNotifications()
notificationService.getUserNotifications(userId)

// After (correct)
notificationService.instance.initializePushNotifications()
notificationService.instance.getUserNotifications(userId)
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/screens/Splash/SplashScreen.tsx` - Fixed `initializePushNotifications` call
- `src/store/slices/notificationsSlice.ts` - Fixed `getUserNotifications` call
- `src/context/AppContext.tsx` - Fixed `getUserNotifications` call

### 2. Fixed UserAvatar Component

**Problem**: The `UserAvatar` component was trying to call `UserImageService.generateInitials()` but the method didn't exist in the service.

**Solution**: Added missing methods to the `userImageService`:

```typescript
// Added to userImageService.ts
export interface UserImageInfo {
  userId: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  hasImage: boolean;
  fallbackInitials: string;
}

public static generateInitials(name: string): string {
  if (!name || typeof name !== 'string') {
    return 'U';
  }
  
  const words = name.trim().split(' ');
  if (words.length === 1) {
    return words[0].charAt(0).toUpperCase();
  }
  return (words[0].charAt(0) + words[words.length - 1].charAt(0)).toUpperCase();
}

public async getUserImageInfo(userId: string, userName?: string): Promise<UserImageInfo> {
  // Implementation for getting user image info
}
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/services/core/userImageService.ts` - Added missing methods and interfaces
- `src/components/UserAvatar.tsx` - Fixed imports and method calls
- Fixed Image style compatibility issues

### 3. Import and Export Fixes

**Problem**: Various import/export issues were causing undefined method errors.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed import paths for `UserImageInfo` and `UserImageService`
- Added proper exports to `userImageService.ts`
- Fixed Image component style compatibility

## Remaining Issue

### Wallet Service Still Undefined

The wallet service `createWalletFromMnemonic` method is still showing as undefined. This suggests there might be a deeper issue with the service initialization or import chain.

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check if the `solanaWalletService` is properly initialized
2. Verify the import chain from `walletService` → `solanaWalletService`
3. Check if there are any circular dependencies or initialization order issues

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:

1. ✅ **No Notification Service Errors** - Push notifications should initialize properly
2. ✅ **No UserAvatar Errors** - The "Cannot read property 'generateInitials' of undefined" error should be resolved
3. ✅ **Better Error Handling** - More graceful fallbacks for missing user images
4. ⚠️ **Wallet Service Still Needs Investigation** - The wallet service issue persists and needs further investigation

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/Splash/SplashScreen.tsx` - Fixed notification service call
- `src/store/slices/notificationsSlice.ts` - Fixed notification service call
- `src/context/AppContext.tsx` - Fixed notification service call
- `src/services/core/userImageService.ts` - Added missing methods and interfaces
- `src/components/UserAvatar.tsx` - Fixed imports and method calls

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Wallet Service Issue** - The wallet service undefined error needs further investigation
2. **Test Dashboard Functionality** - Verify that the dashboard loads without the UserAvatar and notification errors
3. **Monitor for Additional Errors** - Check if there are any other undefined method errors

The notification service and UserAvatar issues should now be resolved, but the wallet service issue requires further investigation to determine the root cause.
