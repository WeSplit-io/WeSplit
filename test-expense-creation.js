console.log('');

console.log('📋 Steps to test:');
console.log('1. Create a new expense in your app');
console.log('2. Check the console logs for these messages:');
console.log('');
console.log('   🔄 Hybrid: Trying Firebase for createExpense');
console.log('   🔥 Creating expense with data: {...}');
console.log('   🔥 Validating expense data...');
console.log('   🔥 Transformed data for Firestore: {...}');
console.log('   🔥 Adding document to expenses collection...');
console.log('   🔥 Expense document created with ID: [some-id]');
console.log('   🔥 Updating group expense count for group: [group-id]');
console.log('   🔥 Updated group expense count to: [new-count]');
console.log('   🔥 Created expense successfully: {...}');
console.log('');

console.log('🔍 What to look for in the logs:');
console.log('- paid_by should be a valid user ID (not empty)');
console.log('- splitData.memberIds should be an array of user IDs (not empty)');
console.log('- splitData.amountPerPerson should be calculated correctly');
console.log('- splitData.splitType should be "equal" or "manual"');
console.log('');

console.log('❌ Common issues to check:');
console.log('- If you see "Firebase failed, falling back to SQLite", there might be a Firebase config issue');
console.log('- If paid_by is empty, the frontend fix didn\'t work');
console.log('- If splitData.memberIds is empty, the member selection didn\'t work');
console.log('- If the expense ID is NaN, there\'s an issue with Firebase document creation');
console.log('');

console.log('✅ Expected result:');
console.log('- New expense should appear in the group details');
console.log('- Balance calculations should work for the new expense');
console.log('- Old expenses with missing data will be skipped gracefully');
