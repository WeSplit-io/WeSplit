# Metro Bundling Fix - Android Build Error Resolution

## Issue Summary

The Android bundling was failing with the following error:
```
TypeError: The "to" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
    at Object.relative (node:path:502:5)
    at node_modules/@expo/metro-config/src/serializer/fork/js.ts:109:35
    at getModuleParams (node_modules/@expo/metro-config/src/serializer/fork/js.ts:65:71)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **version incompatibility** between Expo CLI and Metro packages:

1. **Expo CLI Version Mismatch**: The global Expo CLI (v0.24.21) was incompatible with the local Metro packages (v0.82.5)
2. **Package Export Issues**: The Expo CLI was trying to import Metro modules that weren't properly exported in the installed version
3. **Node.js Version Warnings**: Multiple packages required Node.js >=20.19.4 but the system was running v20.9.0

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Expo CLI Installation
- Installed the correct `@expo/cli` package globally
- Ensured compatibility between Expo CLI and Metro versions

### 2. Resolved Metro Version Compatibility
- Downgraded Metro packages to match Expo 53.0.22 requirements:
  - `metro@^0.82.5`
  - `metro-config@^0.82.5` 
  - `metro-resolver@^0.82.5`

### 3. Fixed WebSocket Polyfill Issue
- Updated `polyfills.ts` to use native WebSocket instead of Node.js `ws` module
- Replaced problematic `require('ws')` with proper WebSocket polyfill

### 4. Maintained Metro Configuration
- Kept the existing metro.config.js with polyfill aliases
- Preserved the serializer configuration that disables problematic modules

## Files Modified

1. **polyfills.ts**: Fixed WebSocket polyfill to avoid Node.js module conflicts
2. **package.json**: Updated Metro package versions for compatibility
3. **metro.config.js**: Restored original configuration without diagnostic filter

## Verification

- ✅ Metro bundler starts successfully
- ✅ No more `path.relative(projectRoot, undefined)` errors
- ✅ Expo development server runs without issues
- ✅ Android bundling command executes (fails only due to no device/emulator, not bundling errors)

## Key Learnings

1. **Version Compatibility**: Always ensure Expo CLI and Metro packages are compatible versions
2. **Polyfill Management**: Avoid importing Node.js-specific modules in React Native polyfills
3. **Package Exports**: Modern Node.js packages use strict export definitions that can cause import failures

## Prevention

- Use `npx expo@<version>` to ensure CLI version matches project requirements
- Regularly update packages together to maintain compatibility
- Test bundling after any major package updates
