# Wallet Service Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Double Instance Access**: The `walletService` was trying to access `solanaWalletService.instance.instance.createWalletFromMnemonic()` instead of `solanaWalletService.instance.createWalletFromMnemonic()`
2. **Missing Import**: The `getReceivedPaymentRequests` function was being used but not imported in DashboardScreen
3. **Incorrect Import Path**: The `createUsdcRequestUri` function was imported from the wrong module

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Double Instance Access in WalletService (`src/services/wallet/walletService.ts`)

**Problem**: The walletService was using double instance access (`solanaWalletService.instance.instance.methodName()`) which was causing "Cannot read property 'createWalletFromMnemonic' of undefined" errors.

**Solution**: Fixed all double instance accesses to use single instance access:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const result = await solanaWalletService.instance.instance.createWalletFromMnemonic();
return await solanaWalletService.instance.instance.getWalletInfo();
const balance = await solanaWalletService.instance.instance.getBalance();
return solanaWalletService.instance.instance.getWalletInfo();

// After (correct)
const result = await solanaWalletService.instance.createWalletFromMnemonic();
return await solanaWalletService.instance.getWalletInfo();
const balance = await solanaWalletService.instance.getBalance();
return solanaWalletService.instance.getWalletInfo();
```

**Methods Fixed**:
- `createWallet()` - Fixed double instance access
- `getUserWallet()` - Fixed double instance access  
- `getUserWalletBalance()` - Fixed double instance access
- `getCurrentWallet()` - Fixed double instance access

### 2. Fixed Missing Import in DashboardScreen (`src/screens/Dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`)

**Problem**: The `getReceivedPaymentRequests` function was being used but the import was commented out, causing "Property 'getReceivedPaymentRequests' doesn't exist" error.

**Solution**: Uncommented and corrected the import:

```typescript
// Before (commented out)
// import { createPaymentRequest, getReceivedPaymentRequests } from '../../services/payments';

// After (correct import)
import { getReceivedPaymentRequests } from '../../services/payments/firebasePaymentRequestService';
```

### 3. Fixed Incorrect Import Path for createUsdcRequestUri

**Problem**: The `createUsdcRequestUri` function was imported from the wrong module, causing import errors.

**Solution**: Corrected the import path:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
import { createUsdcRequestUri } from '../../services/core';

// After (correct)
import { createUsdcRequestUri } from '../../services/core/solanaPay';
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues were caused by:

1. **Inconsistent Service Architecture**: The `solanaWalletService` uses a lazy singleton pattern with a getter, but the `walletService` was incorrectly accessing it with double `.instance` calls
2. **Import Management**: Some imports were commented out during development but the functions were still being used
3. **Module Reorganization**: Functions were moved between modules but imports weren't updated accordingly

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:

1. ✅ **No Wallet Creation Errors**: The "Cannot read property 'createWalletFromMnemonic' of undefined" error should be resolved
2. ✅ **No Balance Loading Errors**: The "Cannot read property 'getBalance' of undefined" error should be resolved
3. ✅ **No Payment Requests Errors**: The "Property 'getReceivedPaymentRequests' doesn't exist" error should be resolved
4. ✅ **Proper Wallet Functionality**: Wallet creation, balance loading, and payment requests should work correctly
5. ✅ **No Import Errors**: All imports should resolve correctly

## Files Modified

- `src/services/wallet/walletService.ts` - Fixed double instance access in all wallet methods
- `src/screens/Dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Fixed missing import for getReceivedPaymentRequests and createUsdcRequestUri

## Testing

The fixes should resolve:
- Wallet creation and initialization errors
- Balance loading errors in the dashboard
- Payment requests loading errors
- Import resolution errors

Try logging into the app again - the wallet functionality should now work properly without the undefined property errors!
