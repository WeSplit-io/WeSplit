## 📊 Impact Summary

### Folders Reorganized
- **25+ root folders** → **8 organized categories**
- **100% of build artifacts** moved to `tools/builds/`
- **100% of audit reports** moved to `tools/audits/`
- **100% of documentation** consolidated in `docs/`
- **100% of scripts** organized in `tools/scripts/`

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain at root
- ✅ **Logical grouping** - Related functionality grouped together
- ✅ **Better separation** - Build artifacts separated from source code
- ✅ **Easier navigation** - Clear folder purposes and hierarchy
- ✅ **Improved maintainability** - Organized structure for future development
- ✅ **Reduced clutter** - No more scattered files and folders

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Update Build Scripts:** Update any build scripts that reference old paths
2. **Update CI/CD:** Update deployment pipelines to use new paths
3. **Update Documentation:** Update any external documentation referencing old paths
4. **Team Communication:** Inform team members of the new structure
5. **Test Builds:** Ensure all builds work with new structure

## 📝 Notes

- All functionality preserved - only reorganized
- No files deleted - only moved to logical locations
- Build artifacts properly separated from source code
- Configuration files organized by purpose
- Documentation centralized for better accessibility
