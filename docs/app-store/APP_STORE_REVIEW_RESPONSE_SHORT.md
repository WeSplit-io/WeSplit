## Clarification: WeSplit is NOT a Cryptocurrency Exchange

WeSplit is a **bill-splitting app** that uses cryptocurrency for settlements, NOT a cryptocurrency exchange. We do not fall under Guideline 3.1.5(iii).

### Key Points:

**No On-Ramp (Fiat to Crypto):**
- Users cannot buy cryptocurrency through our app
- MoonPay integration is disabled (shows "Coming Soon")
- Users must already own cryptocurrency in external wallets
- Deposit only via receiving crypto from external wallets

**No Off-Ramp (Crypto to Fiat):**
- Users cannot sell cryptocurrency for fiat currency
- Withdrawals only send crypto to external crypto wallets
- No bank account integration or fiat payouts

**No Exchange Services:**
- We do not facilitate fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat transactions
- We do not require MSB registration
- All transactions are peer-to-peer crypto transfers on Solana blockchain
- We facilitate expense splitting, not currency exchange

**Currency Conversion:**
- `convertFiatToUSDC` is for display/calculation only (like a currency converter)
- Does not facilitate actual exchange transactions

**Conclusion:**
WeSplit is a utility app for expense management (like Venmo) but uses cryptocurrency instead of fiat. Users must already own crypto and can only transfer crypto between wallets. No exchange services are provided.

We request review under standard utility app guidelines, not cryptocurrency exchange guidelines.
